Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**

**January 8th**

**January 9th**
I worked on finding data set today. I tried to find a data set on Kaggle of all handwritten characters. Although I found one at last, but I could not download it. Although Lauren shared the folder with me, I still could not download on my computer since it is too big. Tomoorrow, I will try airdrop from Lauren's computer. 
Also, I read the article for recognizing handwriting in general and focus spefically on visualizing the image. Tomorrow, once I get the dataset, I will encode the text file and try to visualize all images first on jupiter notebook.

**January 10th**
First, I figured out getting the dataset and finally downloaded it. Also, I worked on reading the text data of hundreds images and figured out how to show images on jupitor notebook. Through today's work, I leanred how to read images using codes and how to plot png files. Moreover, I reviewed how to read text file which cost me some time to look back. I was still working on analyzing the dataset including categorical and quantitative data. 
Tomorrow, I will start to train my data using the cross validation.

**January 13th**
Today, I was going to work on training my data, but after trying for a few times, I found it is easier or only works to split the image file first. As a result, I worked on analyzing and splitting the image file that is written in this form, 'data_subset/a01-000u-s00-00.png', in order for future training and testing data. However, I met some problems that although I append names to the list, the list only showed "1" in each bracket. I will figure out and ask Lauren for help tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I will first figure out the problem, and hopefully work on training dataset as I planned on January 10th.

**January 15th**
I worked on the problem yesterday and figured out that I was looping through the wrong list file. After running the whole list, I realized that I had to transfer the list into matrix form. As a result, I searched Encoder and transformed data into X, Y that coudl be trained. Today, I also read the usage of Keras package to get an initial idea of how to use it for training data.
Tomorrow, hopefully I can apply Keras package to my dataset and firstly train my data using an applicable dataset directly.
