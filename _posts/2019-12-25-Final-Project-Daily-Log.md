I worked on finding data set today. I tried to find a data set on Kaggle of all handwritten characters. Although I found one at last, but I could not download it. Although Lauren shared the folder with me, I still could not download on my computer since it is too big. Tomoorrow, I will try airdrop from Lauren's computer. 
Also, I read the article for recognizing handwriting in general and focus spefically on visualizing the image. Tomorrow, once I get the dataset, I will encode the text file and try to visualize all images first on jupiter notebook.
