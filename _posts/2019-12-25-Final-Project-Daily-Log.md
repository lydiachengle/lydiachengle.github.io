I worked on finding data set today. I tried to find a data set on Kaggle of all handwritten characters. Although I found one at last, but I could not download it. Although Lauren shared the folder with me, I still could not download on my computer since it is too big. Tomoorrow, I will try airdrop from Lauren's computer. 
Also, I read the article for recognizing handwriting in general and focus spefically on visualizing the image. Tomorrow, once I get the dataset, I will encode the text file and try to visualize all images first on jupiter notebook.

**January 10th**
First, I figured out getting the dataset and finally downloaded it. Also, I worked on reading the text data of hundreds images and figured out how to show images on jupitor notebook. Through today's work, I leanred how to read images using codes and how to plot png files. Moreover, I reviewed how to read text file which cost me some time to look back. I was still working on analyzing the dataset including categorical and quantitative data. 
Tomorrow, I will start to train my data using the cross validation.
