Classification Project

Project Description:
This is the classification project we did in our Machine Learning class, which we took a school data set with different variables, such as highest degree, retention, faculty salary, etc, to predict if the college is profit or non-profit. 

Data Analysis: 
As we took in the data, we first only took categoires that are applicable and use a method called selectbest to see which features have the most statistically significant relationships with profit status. Given six classification method, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, Log Regression, KNN classifier, SVM classifier, and Random Forest, I graphed a comparative ROC plot (shown below).

Ranking for Worst Colleges:
(1) Logic / Algorithm
For six of my variables that are highly related which I found in the data analysis section, I keep them in my dataset. Among six of them, four of them instructional expenditure, retention, faculty salary,7_year repayment completion, and 5_year declining balance are all positively related to the school score, which means the higher of the number, the better the schools are. The other two, tuition revenue and pell grant debt are negatively affect the school scores because students have to pay more and loan debt after they graduate.
The porpotion of all positive factors and negative factors are made based on my personal opinion. The money the college spends on teaching and all equipments are the most important part for students to have good college studying experience; 7_year repayment is a way to examine whether students have bright futures after they graduate. For two negative factors, pell grant debt weighs much more than tuition revenue because many students are able to pay for the tuition and still own debt which is a more serious negative influence.
(2) Result:
10 worst schools: 
Thuy Princess Beauty College, Total Look School of Cosmetology & Massage The..., Hair Academy of Safford, Strayer University-North Charlotte, South University-West Palm Beach, Strayer University-Cobb Campus, Citadel Military College of South Carolina, Hawaii Pacific University, and two schools with index of 2778, 755 that do not have name on it.


Factors for Non-predatory Colleges:
Tuition is definetely the first priority for people to measure if the college is predatory or not. Lower annual tuition lead to a lower possibility that the school will gain profits from it. Also, instrumental expenditure is another important factor that contrasts the tuition. Those two factors should be higherly correlated. If the the tuition is high, it only makes sense if the school spends a lot of money on building a better environment for students to learn and enjoy, otherwise the school might be considered as predatory. It is important to find a balance between tuition and instrumental expenditure. In addition, the other factor that relates is the 7_year repayment, which shows the potential of students earning debts back later. Some students might loan debts right after they graduate, but with the education they've taknen, it is possible that they will earn money in a period of time.
According to the article "Predatory loans and the schools that get poor students to take them", many schools advertise themselves, so students will borrow a lot of money and know that they are likely to get good jobs after they leave that will allow you to pay the loans back. However, it is more likely that the loans will not be back. As the Harvard Project on Predatory Student Lending explains, many shady for-profit colleges promise incredible job placement rates for graduates despite not being able to deliver. What colleges say is unreliable and sometimes misleading.

The Obama administration’s rules on for-profit colleges are based on two statistical measures of individual programs: how much money typical program graduates are required to spend on student loan payments every year, and how much they earn in the job market two years after graduation. If this “debt-to-earnings ratio” is too high for multiple years — if graduates need to spend too much of their income paying down loans — then the program is ruled ineligible to receive federal financial aid. It proves the first point, but in a more officil way

Also, checking some reference websites before choosing colleges is important.Use the education department’s College Scorecard or College Navigator tool for details on a schools' performance. The scorecard can show graduates’ salaries and how many students earn incomes that are above workers with only a high school diploma. These details are important because people want to attend a school only if they are confident that they will earn enough to make the program worthwhile.
